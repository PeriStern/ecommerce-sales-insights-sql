--What percentage of customers placed only one order vs. multiple orders?
--What's the average time between orders for repeat customers?
--Which customers are your most loyal (number of orders and total spend)?

--Customers -  CustomerID, CompanyName
--Orders - OrderID, CustomerID, OrderDate
--OrderDetails - OrderID, UnitPrice, Quantity

SELECT * 
FROM Orders
WHERE OrderID IN (
    SELECT OrderID
    FROM Orders
    GROUP BY CustomerID
    HAVING COUNT(OrderID) = 1
);
